# TetrisHero

Based on [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), [Guitar Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero) and [Crypt of the Necrodancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer).

TetrisHero is a competitive multiplayer game. Two players compete against each other trying to survive. By moving the grid of their arena, the players change the tetromino spawn position of the other arena.

The rithm of the tetromino fall is ruled by the amazing [8-bit We Will Rock You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyONm92KluY) song.
